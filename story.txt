One day Tim is hanging out with his friends on the street. A car suddenly accelerates 
and hits him as he crosses the road. The last thing he cound remember is the sound of 
ambulance siren and then he losses his consciousness. When he wake up he finds himself 
on the hospital bed. A doctor comes in, smiles to him and says:"Welcome to 2200."

After Tim gathered himself from hearing that news, he started to look around his hospital
room. He began to notice new technologies that didn't exist from before the incident. A robot 
nurse wheeled up to him and offered him water and a snack. There was no TV on the wall but 
instead a hologram, showing him a player of some sport he couldn't recognize. As the doctor 
left, he pulled up a hologram of Tim's body. Tim saw red, yellow and green spots of his body
that matched up well with how much pain he felt in each of those areas. Tim began to wonder 
what else was different in this new and unfamiliar time.
